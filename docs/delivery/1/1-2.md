# 1-2 Add Identity Aware Proxy protection

## Description
Integrate Google Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) with the n8n Cloud Run deployment to provide Google-based authentication before users can access the n8n interface. This adds an additional security layer ensuring only authorized users can access the workflow automation platform.

## Requirements
1. Configure Identity Aware Proxy for the Cloud Run service ✅
2. Set up OAuth consent screen for IAP if not already configured ✅
3. Create IAP-enabled load balancer with backend service pointing to Cloud Run ✅
4. Configure appropriate IAM roles for authorized users ✅
5. Update Terraform to provision all IAP-related resources ✅
6. Ensure n8n still functions correctly behind the proxy ✅
7. Provide documentation for managing user access ✅

## Implementation Summary
- **Removed conditional IAP logic**: IAP is now always enabled for maximum security
- **Added required APIs**: Compute Engine and IAP APIs are automatically enabled
- **Created load balancer infrastructure**: External HTTPS load balancer with Cloud Run NEG backend
- **Configured IAP authentication**: OAuth brand, IAP client, and backend service IAP configuration
- **Updated Cloud Run settings**: Changed ingress to INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER only
- **Modified environment variables**: n8n URLs now use load balancer IP or custom domain
- **Added IAM policies**: Authorized users get `roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor` role
- **Updated documentation**: README includes IAP setup and user management instructions

## Implementation Plan
1. Research IAP integration requirements for Cloud Run services
2. Add Google Compute Engine API enablement (required for load balancers)
3. Create external HTTPS load balancer with Cloud Run NEG backend
4. Configure IAP on the load balancer backend service
5. Set up OAuth brand and consent screen if needed
6. Add IAM resources for managing IAP access
7. Update variables for user email allowlists
8. Test end-to-end authentication flow
9. Document user management procedures

## Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify that IAP correctly protects n8n access while maintaining functionality.

**Test Scope**: Load balancer creation, IAP configuration, authentication flow, and n8n operation

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to Google login
- Authorized users can access n8n after authentication
- n8n webhooks and API endpoints work through the load balancer
- OAuth flows for Google services still function correctly
- IAP access can be granted/revoked via IAM

**Success Criteria**: 
- `terraform apply` provisions IAP-protected n8n instance
- Only authorized Google accounts can access the interface
- All n8n functionality works behind IAP
- User access management is straightforward

## Verification
- Confirm unauthenticated access is blocked with Google login redirect
- Verify authorized users can access n8n interface after Google authentication
- Test that n8n workflows and webhooks function correctly through the load balancer
- Validate that user access can be managed via Google Cloud IAM
- Ensure OAuth integrations with Google services still work

## Files Modified
- `iac/main.tf` ✅ - Added IAP and load balancer resources, removed conditional logic
- `iac/variables.tf` ✅ - Added IAP-related variables, removed enable_iap toggle
- `iac/outputs.tf` ✅ - Added n8n_iap_url and load_balancer_ip outputs  
- `iac/terraform.tfvars.example` ✅ - Added required iap_authorized_users example
- `README.md` ✅ - Documented IAP configuration, user management, and custom domain setup
