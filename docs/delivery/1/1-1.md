# 1-1 Align Terraform with manual deployment guide

## Description
Update and extend the existing Terraform configuration in `contrib/self-host-n8n-on-gcr/terraform` so that it provisions all resources and configurations described in the manual deployment guide and README. This includes Cloud SQL, Artifact Registry, IAM roles, Secret Manager, Cloud Run, and outputs.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-01-27 10:30:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | assistant |
| 2025-01-27 10:35:00 | Status Update | Proposed | Agreed | User approved task scope and requirements | assistant |
| 2025-01-27 10:36:00 | Status Update | Agreed | InProgress | Started implementation work | assistant |

## Requirements
1. Terraform resources must cover every manual step outlined in the guide.
2. Terraform variables should have sensible defaults and be overridable via `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Running `terraform apply` with an example `terraform.tfvars` should result in a working n8n instance.
4. Running `terraform destroy` should cleanly remove all resources.

## Implementation Plan
1. Review the manual deployment steps documented in the project README and any local reference snippets to compile a complete checklist of required Google Cloud resources.
2. Create a new Terraform module under `iac/` (e.g. `iac/main.tf`, `iac/variables.tf`, etc.).
3. Add or modify resources in `iac/` to ensure full feature parity (e.g., Cloud SQL flags, secret IAM bindings, environment variables).
4. Update `variables.tf` with any new inputs and defaults.
5. Update `outputs.tf` to expose service URL and other useful info.
6. Test apply/destroy using a sandbox project.
7. Update README with Terraform usage instructions.

## Verification
- Confirm `terraform apply` completes successfully and outputs a reachable Cloud Run URL.
- Access the n8n instance and verify basic login page loads.
- Verify Google Cloud Console shows all resources with expected names.
- Confirm `terraform destroy` removes all resources.

## Files Modified
- `iac/**/*.tf`
- `README.md` (root) â€“ add Terraform usage instructions
